# Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Traffic Forecasting

This folder concludes the code and data of our AGCRN model.

## Structure:

* data: including PEMSD4 and PEMSD8 dataset used in our experiments

* lib: contains self-defined modules for our work, such as data loading, data pre-process, normalization, and evaluate metrics.

* model: implementation of our AGCRN model

* pre-trained: saved models for PEMSD4 and PEMSD8 dataset

## Requirements

Python 3.6.5, Pytorch 1.1.0, Numpy 1.16.3, argparse and configparser
